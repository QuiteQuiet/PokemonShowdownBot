    """Mainly a wrapper class for the Robot class, implementing required methods.

    This implements the major method required: splitMessage. Also manages the
    delegation of tasks to their respective handlers. Most of the underlying
    functionality and/or function calls can be found in the inherited class
    PokemonShowdownBot in robot.py.

    You should expect to be somewhat familiar with the PS protocols outlined here:
    https://github.com/Zarel/Pokemon-Showdown/blob/master/PROTOCOL.md

    For the sake of simplicity, we assume that the command char used is ~ in the documentation.
    Utility like functions are placed in the PokemonShowdownBot class, to make this handler
    class look cleaner.

    Attributes:
        do: Command method, handles command behaviour (i.e. ~git returns a url to this project)
        usernotes: MessageDatabase, which handles/logs all PMs sent from users
